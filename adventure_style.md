# Adventure Style — Wychwood Campaign

## Tone
**"What if George R.R. Martin wrote Eye of the Beholder"**

Dark, gritty, morally complex. Nobody is purely good. Trust is earned slowly and broken easily. Death is ugly and permanent. Sex and violence exist in this world and aren't shied away from — but serve the story, not spectacle. A bit of gratuity here and there never hurt anyone.

## Inspiration
- George R.R. Martin — political complexity, moral ambiguity, consequences that cascade, characters who die
- Eye of the Beholder — classic dungeon crawling, party-based exploration, descending into darkness, the dungeon as a character
- David Gemmell — warrior ethos, earned heroism, brutal combat
- Joe Abercrombie — subverted expectations, ugly truths, dark humour

## Core Themes
- **Racial tension:** Elves and humans share a world but not trust. Half-elves exist in the margin. This isn't abstract — it's slurs muttered behind hands, doors that close, prices that double, help that never comes.
- **Identity and belonging:** Wychwood straddles two worlds and is accepted by neither. His quest is as much about finding where he fits as finding what happened to his father.
- **The cost of war:** The Battle of Aeltharin Vale is over, but its consequences are still unfolding. Veterans carry scars — visible and otherwise. The peace is fragile.
- **Trust and betrayal:** Companions have their own agendas. Not everyone who travels with you is on your side.

## Pacing
- **Levels 1-2:** Overland travel from Millhaven toward Aeltharin Vale. Encounters with the world, its prejudices, and its dangers. Recruit companions.
- **Levels 3-4:** Deeper into contested territory. The journey becomes more dangerous. Recruit final companion. Approach the Vale.
- **Level 5+:** The dungeon. A ruin with history, factions, and secrets. The truth about what happened to Caelen.

## Combat
- Tactical, dangerous, and consequential
- Start with CR 1/4 to 1/2 creatures at level 1
- Scale gradually — the world doesn't exist to be fair
- Deadly encounters get warnings — the world is honest about its dangers even if people aren't
- Failed forward — defeat means consequences, not necessarily death

## Companions
- Recruited during the journey (target: party of 4 by level 5)
- Each has their own reasons for heading toward Aeltharin Vale
- Hidden agendas tracked in `dm_only/story_prep.md`
- Loyalty is earned through actions, not assumed
- Betrayal is possible — and should feel earned, not arbitrary

## The Dungeon
- Narrative structure, not random rooms
- Factions within the dungeon with competing interests
- History embedded in the architecture
- Multiple approaches to problems (combat, stealth, negotiation, trickery)
- The dungeon remembers what happened here — and so do some of its inhabitants

## Session Notes & Record-Keeping
- **Verbose notes.** Session notes and adventure log entries should be detailed and richly written — not bullet-point summaries. Capture dialogue, atmosphere, sensory detail, emotional beats, and the texture of scenes. If the story proves worthy, these notes should be good enough to write up into prose.
- Describe what characters *feel*, not just what they do. Note the silence after a hard truth lands, the way someone's hand moves to a weapon, the quality of the light.
- Adventure log entries are narrative recaps, not mechanical records. Write them like chapters, not minutes.
