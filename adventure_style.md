# Adventure Style Guide

## World Setting: Dark Krynn

A world similar to Krynn from Dragonlance, but darker and grittier:

### The World
- **War-scarred lands** recovering from devastating dragon wars that reshaped the world
- **Ancient ruins** from fallen civilizations hold dangerous secrets and forgotten power
- **Gods and divine magic** are mysterious - their presence uncertain, recently returned, or contested
- **Dragons** are world-shaking threats that inspire terror, not just powerful monsters
- **Moral complexity** - few things are purely good or evil; most people survive in the gray
- **Lost knowledge** - much history and lore was destroyed; truth is hard to find
- **Refugees and survivors** - many communities are recent, formed from survivors of destruction
- **Magic has a cost** - arcane and divine power are dangerous and not to be used lightly

### Society & Culture
- Trade routes are dangerous; towns are isolated
- Trust is earned slowly; strangers are viewed with suspicion
- Old kingdoms have fallen; new power structures are emerging
- Racial tensions exist - survivors blame each other for the wars
- Adventurers are both needed and feared

## Tone & Mood

**Gritty and deadly dark fantasy:**

- **Danger is real and ever-present** - combat can be lethal, injuries matter, healing is limited
- **Resources are precious** - gold is scarce, magic items are rare, every healing potion counts
- **Choices have harsh consequences** that ripple forward through the campaign
- **Death is possible but fair** - threats are telegraphed through environmental clues, NPC warnings, and common sense
- **Moments of hope shine brighter** against the darkness - heroism and beauty matter more in bleak times
- **NPCs have their own agendas** - they may betray, deceive, refuse help, or pursue conflicting goals
- **The world doesn't wait** - events happen whether the PC acts or not; villains advance their plans
- **Failure moves the story forward** - defeat doesn't mean game over, it means consequences and new complications

### Narrative Style
- Visceral, atmospheric prose - show don't tell
- Combat is brutal and physical, described with impact
- NPCs have strong personalities and speak with distinct voices
- The world pushes back - not everyone wants to help
- Let the player discover through exploration, not exposition

## Adventure Type: Classic Dungeon Crawl

Focus on:
- **Exploring dangerous dungeons, ruins, and underground complexes**
- **Tactical combat encounters** with meaningful resource management
- **Finding treasure and secrets** - rare but meaningful rewards
- **Environmental hazards** - traps, natural dangers, difficult terrain
- **Monster encounters** that tell a story about the dungeon's history
- **Multiple approaches** to problems (stealth, social, combat, clever thinking)
- **Interconnected dungeon design** with shortcuts, secret paths, and vertical exploration

## Combat Style: Deep Tactical

**Turn-by-turn tactical combat:**
- Full tactical combat with positioning, terrain, and environmental factors
- **ASCII maps provided** showing combatant positions, terrain features, obstacles, and scale
- Each turn presents meaningful tactical choices
- Party members act on their own initiative order
- **Player directs ALL party members each turn** (PC + any companions) - no auto-pilot
- Clear communication of enemy capabilities and visible threats
- Monsters use tactics appropriate to their intelligence and nature
- **Retreat is always an option** when things go badly
- Cover, height advantage, flanking, and positioning matter
- Environmental elements can be used tactically (furniture, fire, water, etc.)

## Encounter Difficulty: Challenging

**Balanced challenge with real stakes:**

### Starting Difficulty (Level 1-2)
- First 2-3 combat encounters should be **CR 1/4 to 1/2 creatures** (bandits, giant rats, goblins)
- Allow players to learn combat mechanics without instant-death risk
- Single tougher enemies are more dangerous than groups of weak enemies due to action economy

### Scaling Difficulty
- **Level 1-2:** CR 1/4 to 1/2 enemies, maybe one CR 1 with warning
- **Level 3-4:** CR 1 enemies become standard, CR 2 with preparation
- **Level 5+:** CR 2+ and bigger threats

### Encounter Design
- **3-4 combat encounters** expected per adventuring day before long rest needed
- Deadly encounters (above party level) are possible but **clearly signaled**:
  - NPCs warn the party ("that's suicide, you need help")
  - Environmental clues (skulls, destroyed equipment, signs of great power)
  - Opportunity to scout, retreat, gather allies, or find alternative solutions
- **Action economy matters** - even "balanced" encounters can be deadly at low levels
- Some encounters may be beyond the party's capability - **knowing when to avoid or flee is part of the challenge**

### Creating Tension Without TPK
- Time pressure and moral choices create stakes
- Resource exhaustion (HP, spell slots, hit dice) creates jeopardy
- Tactical retreats are valid and sometimes necessary
- **Fail forward** - if the party loses, the story continues with consequences:
  - Villains escape but leave clues
  - Victims die but the party gains information
  - Party is captured instead of killed
  - Quest becomes harder but not impossible

### Player Agency
- Give chances to scout and gather intelligence
- Provide opportunities to find allies or alternative approaches
- Let preparation and investigation pay off
- Reward clever tactics and creative thinking

## Pacing

- **Exploration and investigation** balanced with combat
- **Time pressure** when appropriate - wounds don't heal instantly, villains advance their plans
- **Short rests** available between encounters when safe
- **Long rests** require true safety (secure location, time)
- Not every session needs combat - social encounters and investigation are equally important
- **Montage or skip mundane travel** - focus on interesting scenes and meaningful moments
- Build tension gradually toward climactic encounters

## Reward Structure

### Experience Points
- XP from combat (monster CR determines XP)
- XP from quest completion and story milestones
- XP from clever solutions that avoid combat

### Treasure
- **Gold is sparse but meaningful** - a few gold pieces matter
- Treasure appropriate to the dungeon's story and inhabitants
- Practical gear (rope, tools, weapons) is often more common than gold

### Magic Items
- **Rare and significant** - not handed out freely
- Each magic item should feel special and have history
- More common at higher levels, but still notable finds

### Other Rewards
- **Information and lore** - maps, journals, clues
- **Allies and contacts** - NPCs who can help
- **Reputation** - word of deeds spreads
- **Consequences** - actions shape the world

## Key Principles

1. **Player agency matters** - choices shape the story
2. **Preparation pays off** - scouting, planning, and allies help
3. **Failure is interesting** - setbacks create new story opportunities
4. **The world is consistent** - NPCs and factions pursue their goals
5. **Danger is fair** - threats are telegraphed, never cheap shots
6. **Resources matter** - every HP, spell slot, and gold piece counts
7. **Heroism is earned** - victories should feel hard-won and meaningful
