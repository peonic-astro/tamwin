# Known NPCs — Wychwood Campaign

## Caelen Shatterstaff (Deceased)
- **Race:** Elf (Silverwood)
- **Relation:** Wychwood's father
- **Status:** Dead. Buried on the hillock outside Millhaven.
- **Details:** A veteran of the Battle of Aeltharin Vale. Before the battle, he was warm, present, and loving — an elf who defied his people's disapproval to raise a half-blood son. Carried Wychwood on his shoulders, taught him to read tracks, sang old Elvish hunting songs. After the battle, he came back changed. Distant. His eyes looked through Wychwood rather than at him. The hands that ruffled his son's hair began to hesitate before they did. He never explained. He never spoke of what happened. His thumb wore a groove into the left armrest of his chair from a restless rhythm that started after the war and never stopped. In his final fever, he gripped Wychwood's wrist with sudden iron strength, his eyes focusing — truly focusing on his son — for the first time in twenty years, and spoke the name *Aeltharin*.
- **Legacy:** His broken staff lies across his cairn. His battered lute is in Wychwood's pack.

## Bryn Ashwick
- **Race:** Human
- **Class:** Fighter
- **From:** Thornbury (three days west on the roads, five off them)
- **Status:** Alive, travelling companion
- **Appearance:** Mid-twenties. Weather-tanned. Dark hair cropped short — hacked with a knife, not cut properly. White scar running from below her left ear to the point of her chin. Brown eyes, hard and direct.
- **Personality:** Practical, guarded, competent. Flat Dalereach accent. Speaks in short, matter-of-fact sentences. Not warm, but fair. Shares food before she shares trust. Sleeps with one hand near her knife. Breaks camp like someone who's done it a hundred times — efficient, no trace left behind.
- **Motivation:** Searching for the truth about her brother Davin Ashwick, who marched with the Dalereach infantry (second company) to Aeltharin Vale twenty years ago at age seventeen. He didn't come home. The official story was death in battle. Bryn doesn't believe it anymore. She has his last letter — the third — kept in waxed cloth on a leather cord around her neck. In it, Davin wrote that things weren't right, orders didn't make sense, men were being pulled from the line at night with no explanation. No letters followed.
- **Skills:** Good camp craft, professional movement through rough country. Carries a sword, knows how to reach for it fast. Two years of preparation for this journey — saved coin, learned the land, talked to veterans (few would talk, those who did had the same haunted look).
- **Relationship with Wychwood:** Practical alliance. He has elven blood that opens doors her humanity can't; she has Dalereach contacts who'd clam up at the sight of his ears. Agreement to travel together "at least for now." No promises beyond the shared direction.

## Minor NPCs (Millhaven)
- **Old Brennan** — Goat farmer on the eastern slope. Raised a hand as Wychwood departed. One of the few.
- **Marta Caide** — Widow. Her late husband used to drink with Caelen before the drinking stopped. Watched Wychwood leave from her doorstep with an expression that was pity or relief.
