# Adventure Log

## Campaign Setup

**Character:** Tamwin Badgerfoot (Stout Halfling Fighter)
**Starting Location:** On the trade road from Burlap
**Starting Date:** Day 1, early spring

### Campaign Tone
- Dark, gritty (Gemmell / Abercrombie / Rothfuss)
- Morally complex, consequences matter
- Death is real, trust is earned
- Classic dungeon crawling with narrative depth

### Character Background
Tamwin was always the biggest kid around—teased that his Ma must have run off with a dwarf, since his Pa wasn't particularly tall. His size helped him get a job on the Burlap town watch. With Ma and Pa aging and a strange tingling calling him to explore, he's left home to see the wider world. Da gave him a firm handshake and carved wooden badger. Ma packed enough provisions to feed a small army. Fond of pipe, food, and ale. Kind soul with strong moral compass.

## Session 1 - The Road Away

**Date:** Day 1, Early Spring
**Location:** Burlap → Old Road → Millstone

### Summary

Tamwin Badgerfoot left his home in Burlap, setting out to explore the wider world. A strange tingling sensation had been growing inside him, pulling him away from the peaceful life under Bagshott Row where Ma and Pa were growing old.

The road led through familiar farmland that gradually gave way to forest. Near Millstone, Tamwin discovered a ransacked merchant cart and signs of violence. Following tracks into the forest, he found three bandits holding a captured merchant.

**First Combat:** Tamwin engaged the bandits using his shortbow and tactical positioning. He killed one bandit with two arrows, wounded another in melee combat with his shortsword, and intimidated both survivors into fleeing. It was his first kill—a weight he's still processing.

He freed Wellan Cray, a cloth merchant from Millstone who had been beaten and robbed. Tamwin showed mercy by letting the surviving bandits go with a warning, believing at least one might reconsider their life choices.

Wellan and Tamwin traveled together to Millstone in the rain. The merchant, deeply grateful, arranged room and board at the Sack and Bushel inn and introduced Tamwin to the locals. Tamwin's shoulder was bruised from a club hit but was treated by the innkeeper's wife.

As Tamwin rested that night, he noticed the strange tingling that had driven him from home had faded to almost nothing—replaced by the hollow reality of what he'd done and what the world beyond Burlap truly costs.

## Session 2 - The Millstone Murders

**Date:** Day 2, Early Spring
**Location:** Millstone village

### Summary

Tamwin woke fully healed on his second day and learned of a crisis gripping Millstone: three villagers murdered by apparent animal attacks over two weeks, panic spreading, and accusations of witchcraft aimed at Elda Farrow, the village herbalist. Village headman Harren Blackwood hired Tamwin for 30 gold to investigate and stop the killings.

Through methodical investigation, Tamwin interviewed both attack survivors—Bess (miller's wife) and Tym (tanner's son)—examined tracks at the mill, and consulted with Elda Farrow. He discovered the truth: four feral dogs belonging to deceased trapper Rodrick Vane had turned to hunting humans after their owner died of fever three weeks prior and they'd consumed his body.

Tamwin assembled a hunting party of five (himself, two militia members, and the two survivors' family members), acquired supplies (poison, pitch, oil, bandages), and tracked the dogs to Rodrick's abandoned cabin northeast of the village. Using tactical planning, he poisoned meat with wolfsbane tincture, placed it in the den while the dogs slept, and eliminated three dogs via poison. The fourth fled wounded and was killed in coordinated combat. The cabin was burned, destroying all evidence.

Tamwin kept his promise to inform Elda first (ensuring her safety from mob violence), then reported to Harren and collected his reward—which he immediately shared with the four men who risked their lives alongside him. The village celebrated their first safe night in weeks.
