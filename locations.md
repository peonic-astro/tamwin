# Known Locations — Wychwood Campaign

## Millhaven
- **Type:** Small human farming settlement
- **Region:** Eastern Dalereach, near the border with Silverwood
- **Description:** A muddy crossroads town of maybe two hundred souls. Timber-framed buildings with thatched roofs. A single tavern, a market square that's more mud than stone, a small chapel. The kind of place people are born, live, and die without ever seeing a city. Wychwood's mother was from here. The locals tolerated Caelen for her sake, and tolerate Wychwood now out of habit more than affection.
- **Notable:** The Shatterstaff family plot is on a hillock north of town, overlooking the treeline where the Silverwood begins. The Shatterstaff cottage sits at the village's northern edge — timber frame, thatched roof, single room downstairs with a hearth, a loft above. Dead herbs hang from the rafters. Wychwood left the door unbarred when he departed.

## The Silverwood — Border Strip
- **Type:** Forest, no-man's-land
- **Region:** Between Millhaven and the elvish border road
- **Description:** The margin of the Silverwood. Birch and ash giving way to oak and elder. Not patrolled by either side in the southern stretches. A place of deer trails and silence. Caelen lived his whole life at its edge.

## The Elvish Border Road
- **Type:** Maintained road through the Silverwood
- **Region:** Runs east-west through a shallow valley of silver birch, deep in the Silverwood
- **Description:** Not paved, but packed hard earth with clean edges bordered by low-growing cultivated plants (creeping thyme or similar). Well-maintained. Patrolled by two-elf teams — patrols have doubled since autumn started, according to Bryn. The road marks the boundary between the border strip and the Silverwood proper.

## The Silverwood Proper
- **Type:** Ancient forest, elven territory
- **Region:** North of the border road
- **Description:** Old growth — oaks and beeches wider than a man's arm-span, branches interlocking overhead like cathedral vaulting. Undergrowth thin but deliberate, mosses and ferns in patterns that look natural until you notice the symmetry. Light through the canopy feels architectural. The trees have been tended — not managed, but respected. Deeper in, the land folds into ridges and narrow valleys with fast, cold streams. The air smells of cold earth, resin, and the faint sweetness of decay.
