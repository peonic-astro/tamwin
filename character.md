## Backstory

Wychwood Shatterstaff was born to an elven father, Caelen Shatterstaff, and a human mother. For the first years of his life, his father was warm — carrying him on his shoulders through the treeline, teaching him to read tracks in soft earth, singing old Elvish hunting songs that Wychwood still hums without thinking.

Then Caelen marched to the Battle of Aeltharin Vale, where the forces of the Dalereach Alliance met the Elvenhosts of the Silverwood in a conflict that nearly shattered the peace between the two peoples. Caelen survived. He came home. But the man who came home was not the man who left.

The hands that used to ruffle Wychwood's hair now hesitated. The eyes that once saw his son now seemed to see something else — something that reminded him of whatever happened in that vale. He never spoke of it. He never explained. He simply... withdrew. Not cruel. Never cruel. Just distant, in the way that a man is distant when he's looking at something far away and can't bring himself to focus on what's in front of him.

Wychwood grew up in that silence. Among the elves of the Silverwood, he was the human's child — proof of Caelen's shame. Among the humans of Millhaven, he was the elf-get — too sharp-eared, too quiet, too *other*. He learned to read people the way he learned to read the forest: by watching, by waiting, by noting which way the wind was blowing before it changed.

His mother died when he was young. His father followed last week. At the end, Caelen spoke a name in his fever — *Aeltharin* — and gripped Wychwood's wrist with a strength that should have left him years ago.

Now Wychwood stands at a fresh grave with a broken staff laid across the cairn, and a name echoing in his skull, and nowhere left to belong.
