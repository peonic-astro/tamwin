## Personality & Backstory

An idealistic hero who believes in using his voice and stories to make the world better. In a grim world scarred by dragon wars and loss, Hamm represents hope - using his performances to remind people of beauty and courage. His physical weakness (STR 7) means he must rely on wit, charm, and the strength of others, but his bold tongue and wild tales can inspire even the most downtrodden to action.

Hamm earned his epithet "Wildtongue" through his fearless habit of speaking truth to power and telling stories others would rather forget. In darker times, when lies and propaganda flow freely, a bard who refuses to compromise becomes dangerous - and valuable.
