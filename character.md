## Backstory
Tamwin Badgerfoot was always the biggest kid around—teased that his Ma must have run off with a dwarf, since his Pa certainly wasn't any taller than anyone else. But his size had its perks, and it helped him land a job on the Burlap town watch.

Now that Ma and Pa are getting on, their small dwelling under Bagshott Row doesn't feel like it fits anymore. Of late, Tamwin's been feeling the pull of the road—like there's more of the world he doesn't know about yet—and a strange tingling inside him that means he NEEDS to know.

So he's set off to explore. Da gave him a firm handshake and a carved wooden badger, and Ma packed him enough provisions to feed a small army.

## Personality
- Kind soul at heart with a strong moral compass
- Fond of a pipe, fonder of dinner and a mug or three of ale
- Curious about the wider world
- Unusually tall for a halfling (source of past teasing but also confidence)
- Protective instincts from watch experience
