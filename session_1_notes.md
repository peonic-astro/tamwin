# Session 1 Notes — The Grave and the Road

## Key Events

### The Cairn (Day 1, Late Afternoon)
Wychwood stood alone at his father Caelen's freshly-built cairn on the hillock north of Millhaven. Caelen's broken staff lay across the river stones. The last mourners — a handful of humans who came for Wychwood's dead mother's memory, not Caelen's — had left an hour prior. No elves attended. Wychwood lingered as the light failed, the name *Aeltharin* sitting in his chest like a swallowed stone, then walked back down the hill to the village.

### Last Night in Millhaven (Day 1, Evening)
Wychwood returned to the Shatterstaff cottage on Millhaven's northern edge. Cold hearth, his dead mother's herbs still hanging in dried bundles from the rafters. He ate cold rabbit, stared at his father's empty chair — the one with the worn groove in the left armrest where Caelen's thumb used to rub back and forth in a restless rhythm that started after the war and never stopped. Restless sleep full of half-shapes: his father's hand, the smell of pine, a valley he's never seen, a figure walking away into the treeline who wouldn't turn if called.

### Departure (Day 2, Dawn)
Wychwood packed the cottage with the efficiency of someone who'd already decided to leave. Took what mattered — gear, rations, arrows, his father's battered lute. Left the door unbarred. Nobody asked where he was going. Nobody asked him to stay. Old Brennan raised a hand as he passed. Marta Caide watched from her doorstep with an expression that might have been pity or relief.

### Into the Silverwood (Day 2, Morning to Midday)
The cart track north of Millhaven died within a mile, thinning to footpath, then deer trail, then nothing. Wychwood moved northeast through the border strip of the Silverwood — the no-man's-land between human territory and the elven domain proper. Six or seven miles from Millhaven by midday. Stopped on a fallen oak to eat dried venison and late blackberries (past their best, soft and sour). No sign of habitation or patrol in the border strip.

### First Camp (Day 2, Afternoon to Night)
Found a spring-fed stream cutting west to east. Made camp in the shelter of young ash trees on the raised bank — no fire, not this deep in the Silverwood. Slept with bow strung and shortsword unsheathed. Woke once after midnight when something large (elk or boar, four-legged, heavy) passed thirty or forty yards to the west. It moved on without pausing.

### The Elvish Road (Day 3, Mid-Morning)
Crossed deeper into the Silverwood proper. Trees older, tended — branches woven into natural screens marking boundaries. Discovered a maintained elvish road running east-west through a shallow valley of silver birch. Wychwood settled into an oak's root hollow and watched for over two hours.

**Elvish Patrol Observed:** Two elves, moving west along the road. Green and grey cloaks, hoods back. Both carried longbows. One had a sword at the hip, the other a pale-metal-shod staff. They moved with practised, easy strides, scanning the treeline. The sword-carrier was young by elvish reckoning — sharp features, pale quick eyes, wearing an expression Wychwood recognised: the settled, unexamined conviction that some things are simply *less*. They passed within forty yards without detecting him. No second patrol came in the following hour.

### Crossing the Road (Day 3, Early Afternoon)
Wychwood crossed the elvish road — three strides on packed earth, into cover on the far side. Heart going harder than it should. No alarm raised. Beyond the road, the Silverwood changed: ancient oaks and beeches, undergrowth thin but deliberate, light through the canopy almost architectural. This was the Silverwood proper — deeper than Caelen ever brought his son.

Found boot prints by a stream — elvish make, narrow sole, single elf moving north with purpose. Yesterday or the day before.

### Meeting Bryn Ashwick (Day 3, Late Afternoon)
Descending into a narrow valley, Wychwood smelled smoke — meat cooking, fat over flame. Found a small, well-made camp tucked under a rock overhang: lean-to, low fire positioned so smoke dispersed against the stone, rabbit on a spit. The camp's occupant was a human woman filling a waterskin at the stream, sword within arm's reach.

Wychwood stepped from cover and announced himself. She moved fast — on her feet, hand on sword, assessing him in one motion. The half-elf calculation happened behind her eyes, as it always does.

**Bryn Ashwick, from Thornbury (three days west on the roads).** Mid-twenties. Dark hair cropped short and hacked with a knife. White scar running from below her left ear to her chin. Brown eyes, hard, direct. Flat Dalereach accent, somewhere west. Travels well — camp craft is professional, moves with economy.

She shared her rabbit. She shared her reason.

**Bryn's Story:** Her brother, Davin Ashwick, marched with the Dalereach infantry (second company) to Aeltharin Vale twenty years ago. He was seventeen. She was four. He didn't come home. The official story was a brave death in the fighting. Bryn no longer believes it. She has his last letter — the third, kept in waxed cloth on a cord around her neck. In it, Davin wrote that things weren't right, that orders didn't make sense, that men were being pulled from the line at night and nobody would say where they went. No letters came after that.

She's been planning this trip for two years. Most veterans won't talk about Aeltharin. Those who will get a look — like Caelen's *different*.

Wychwood shared his own reason: his father fought at Aeltharin on the elven side, came back changed, died whispering the name. They agreed to travel together — complementary skills, complementary access. His elven blood opens doors hers can't, and her Dalereach contacts would shut at the sight of his ears.

**Agreement:** Travel together, at least for now. Honest, practical, no promises beyond the shared direction.

### Night Camp (Day 3, Night)
Bryn took first watch (two hours), then woke Wychwood for second. She slept with one hand near her knife. The night passed without incident. She mentioned the patrol she'd seen that morning was heading east and would circuit back west by tomorrow — they needed to be well north by then.

### The Hanging Rabbits (Day 4, Mid-Morning)
Moving northeast through ancient beech and oak forest. Bryn spotted something at two o'clock through a beech stand — pale shapes hanging from a branch, sixty yards east. They approached in silence, spreading apart to open the angle.

**What they found:** Four rabbits strung up by hind legs from loops of thin cord, gutted and cleaned with precise cuts. Blood drained into a shallow wooden bowl beneath them, dark and thickening. Organs removed and arranged on a flat stone in a deliberate pattern — hearts, livers, kidneys. This is ritual or warning or both.

**Tracks around the tree:** Leaves scuffed in a rough circle around the base. Bare feet, small and shallow — not the weight of an adult elf or human.

**Mark on the tree trunk:** Cut fresh into the bark at eye level. A simple shape — vertical line crossed by two diagonal strokes, like a stylised tree or a figure with arms raised. The sapwood is still pale and wet.

Bryn asked if it meant anything to Wychwood. Session ended before he could respond.

## Current State
- **Day:** 4, mid-morning
- **Location:** Deep Silverwood, beech stand, examining the hanging rabbits and carved symbol
- **Weather:** Cold, frost on the ground at dawn (burned off), overcast
- **Party:** Wychwood + Bryn Ashwick
- **HP:** 12/12 (no combat this session)
- **Resources consumed:** ~2 days rations (supplemented by Bryn's rabbit on Day 3 evening), water refilled multiple times at streams
- **No combat, no dice rolls this session**

## Active Threads
- The carved symbol — what does it mean? Bare feet, small — children? Fey?
- Elvish patrols — doubled since autumn, according to Bryn. The patrol circuit means urgency heading north.
- The single set of purposeful elvish boot prints heading north — who, and why?
- Bryn's brother Davin — pulled from the line at night, never came home
- Caelen's dying word — Aeltharin

## Contradictions to Avoid
- Bryn has a SCAR on her JAW (left ear to chin), not her cheek or forehead
- Bryn's hair is DARK and CROPPED SHORT, hacked with a knife
- Bryn is from THORNBURY, three days west on the roads, five off them
- Davin was in SECOND COMPANY, Dalereach infantry
- Wychwood carries TWO shortswords and a LONGBOW
- The elvish patrol had TWO members — one with sword, one with staff
- The carved symbol is a VERTICAL LINE crossed by TWO DIAGONAL STROKES
- The tracks around the tree are BARE FEET, SMALL, SHALLOW
