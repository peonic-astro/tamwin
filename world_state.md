# World State — Wychwood Campaign

## Current Moment
- **Day:** 4
- **Time:** Mid-morning
- **Season:** Late autumn
- **Weather:** Cold, overcast. Frost at dawn, burned off.
- **Location:** Deep Silverwood, beech stand north of the elvish border road

## Current Situation
Wychwood and Bryn Ashwick stand in a beech stand examining a disturbing find: four gutted rabbits hung from a branch in a deliberate ritual display, blood collected in a wooden bowl, organs arranged on a flat stone. A fresh symbol has been carved into the beech trunk — a vertical line crossed by two diagonal strokes. The tracks around the base of the tree are bare feet, small and shallow — not adult weight. The meaning of the display is unknown.

## Active Quests
- **The Name in the Dark:** Caelen spoke the name "Aeltharin" in his dying fever and gripped Wychwood's wrist. Wychwood knows Aeltharin Vale was the site of the battle that changed his father. He doesn't know what's there, or what happened. He intends to find out.
- **Bryn's Brother:** Bryn Ashwick is searching for the truth about her brother Davin, who marched with the Dalereach infantry to Aeltharin Vale and never returned. His last letter spoke of men being pulled from the line at night.

## World Context
The Dalereach (human territories) and the Silverwood (elven domain) share an uneasy peace following the Battle of Aeltharin Vale, fought roughly twenty years ago. The battle ended in a truce rather than victory for either side, but the resentments it stirred never settled. Half-elves are living reminders of a connection neither side wants to acknowledge. Racial tensions manifest as cold shoulders, slurs, the occasional shove — rarely outright violence, but the threat hums beneath the surface like a wasp nest in a wall. Elvish patrols along the border road have doubled since autumn started.

## Party
- Wychwood Shatterstaff (PC) — Level 1 Half-Elf Ranger
