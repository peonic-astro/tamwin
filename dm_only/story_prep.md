## 1. THE TRUTH OF AELTHARIN VALE

### What the World Believes
The Battle of Aeltharin Vale was a border conflict between the Dalereach Alliance and the Elvenhosts of the Silverwood, fought roughly twenty years ago. Both sides claim the other struck first. It ended in a truce with no clear victor, and the resentments have simmered ever since.

### What Actually Happened

The battle was real, but it was engineered. **Lord Aldric Vane**, a Dalereach noble and military commander, and **Warden Serelith**, an elven war-leader of the Silverwood, were secretly allied in a conspiracy to provoke the conflict. Their motives differed but aligned:

- **Aldric Vane** wanted war to consolidate political power in the Dalereach. A threatened border means military funding, conscription authority, and the silencing of political rivals as "traitors in wartime." He didn't want annihilation of the elves — he wanted a perpetual low-grade threat.
- **Warden Serelith** wanted war to purge the Silverwood of "human contamination" — the growing number of half-elves, human traders, and elves who had married humans. She saw the dilution of elven blood as an existential threat and believed a war would sever ties between the races permanently. She was also a secret devotee of **Morravel**, a dead elven god of purity and separation whose cult had been outlawed by the Silverwood's ruling council centuries ago.

They engineered a series of provocations — a burned human settlement blamed on elves, a murdered elven emissary blamed on humans — until war became inevitable.

### The Atrocity at the Vale

The battle itself was brutal but conventional until the third day. That night, Warden Serelith ordered a **ritual cleansing** — the execution of every half-elf, human-sympathetic elf, and mixed-race prisoner held in the elven camp. This was not sanctioned by the Silverwood's ruling council. It was Serelith's faction acting alone, cloaked by the chaos of battle.

**Caelen Shatterstaff was there.** He was a scout and mid-rank officer in the Elvenhost. He did not participate in the killings — but he **discovered them in progress** and was given a choice by Serelith's lieutenant: join or die. Caelen chose a third option. He fought. He killed two of Serelith's soldiers and freed a handful of prisoners — but not all of them. He was too late for most. Among the dead was **Lirael Dawnmantle**, a half-elf woman who had been Caelen's close friend and who was pregnant with a human man's child.

Caelen fled the camp with the survivors. He reported what he'd seen to the Silverwood command, but in the chaos of the battle's aftermath and the political pressure to secure the truce, **his testimony was buried.** The ruling council chose peace over justice. The dead were listed as "casualties of battle." Serelith was quietly reassigned, not punished.

### Why Caelen Changed

Caelen carried three wounds from that night:

1. **Guilt** — He didn't act soon enough. Lirael died because he hesitated, because he was afraid, because he spent precious minutes trying to decide what to do instead of acting. He replayed those minutes for twenty years.
2. **Shame** — When he looked at Wychwood — his own half-elf son — he saw Lirael's unborn child. He saw what his people were willing to do to children like his son. He couldn't look at Wychwood without seeing what he'd failed to prevent.
3. **Fear** — Serelith's faction survived. They knew Caelen was a witness. He kept silent not just because the council buried the truth, but because speaking meant painting a target on his family. His distance from Wychwood was partly protective — if they came for him, he didn't want them to know how much his son mattered.

### What "Aeltharin" Means Now

Caelen's dying whisper was not just a place name. Hidden beneath the ruins of the Vale's battlefield is the **Sanctum of Morravel** — an ancient temple to the dead god of purity that Serelith's cult used as their base during the battle. Caelen discovered its entrance during his escape with the freed prisoners. Inside is **proof** — carved records, preserved bodies, ritual implements — that the massacre happened and who ordered it.

Caelen never went back. He was too afraid, too broken. On his deathbed, he was trying to tell his son: *the truth is buried there. Go find it.*

## 2. THE DUNGEON — AELTHARIN VALE

### Surface Level: The Battlefield

The Vale is a wide, shallow depression between forested ridgelines. Twenty years of growth have reclaimed most of it, but the scars are visible: earthwork trenches half-collapsed, rusted weapon fragments, the occasional bone turning up through the soil. A few crumbling stone markers — neither human nor elven, just functional — mark mass graves.

**Current occupants:**
- **Thornfield's Reclamation Company** — A human salvage outfit of ~15 people, led by **Captain Maren Thornfield**, who has a royal charter to "reclaim artifacts of historical significance." In practice, they're stripping the battlefield of anything valuable. They've established a base camp at the Vale's eastern mouth. They are NOT aware of the Sanctum below.
- **The Grey Sentinels** — A small group of 4-5 elven veterans who have appointed themselves guardians of the Vale, viewing it as sacred ground. Led by **Aravain Ghostleaf**, an old soldier who fought in the battle and suspects there's more to the story than the official account. They harass the salvage company but lack the numbers for a direct confrontation.

### Level 1: The War-Cellars

Beneath the battlefield, both armies dug extensive tunnel networks — storage rooms, command bunkers, field hospitals, and escape routes. These have partially collapsed over twenty years but remain navigable.

**Key features:**
- Collapsed tunnels requiring Athletics checks or creative solutions to navigate
- Old traps (pit traps, tripwires) still active but degraded (DC 10-12 to detect/disarm)
- Preserved supplies — rusted weapons, rotted rations, intact potions (rare)
- **The Elven Field Hospital** — A large chamber where wounded elves were treated. Still contains beds, surgical tools, and a **journal** belonging to an elven healer named **Saevel** who recorded observations about "soldiers being taken from the hospital at night and not returning." This is the first concrete clue about the massacre.
- **The Human Command Post** — Partially flooded. Contains correspondence between Dalereach officers. One letter fragment references "Lord Vane's assurance that the elves would strike first." Another clue.

**Enemies:** Giant rats, swarms of insects, a carrion crawler that has made a nest in the collapsed field hospital wing. Possible undead — restless dead from the battle, manifesting as shadows or skeletons.

### Level 2: The Ossuary Passage

Deeper than the war-cellars, a natural cave system connects to the tunnels. This is the route Caelen took during his escape. Serelith's cult used these caves to move prisoners to the Sanctum without being observed.

**Key features:**
- Natural cave formations — tight squeezes, underground streams, a collapsed sinkhole open to the sky
- **Cult markings** carved into the walls — the sigil of Morravel (a tree with severed branches, each branch ending in a closed eye). These markings become more frequent as you descend.
- **The Prisoner Route** — Scratches on the walls from fingernails. Drag marks in dried mud. Shackle bolts driven into stone. The passage tells its own story.
- **Caelen's Mark** — At a junction, a symbol scratched into the wall: the Shatterstaff family mark (a broken staff). Caelen left it during his escape. It's the proof that he was here. Wychwood will recognize it immediately.

**Enemies:** Cave-dwelling creatures (darkmantles, piercers, a phase spider). A **wight** — the undead remnant of one of Serelith's soldiers, still wearing cult regalia, still guarding the passage. It can be fought or potentially reasoned with (it is bound by duty but hates what it guards).

### Level 3: The Sanctum of Morravel

The temple complex carved into the bedrock long before the battle. Serelith's cult restored it and used it as their ritual site. This is where the massacre's victims were brought. This is where the proof lies.

**Key features:**
- **The Hall of Branches** — The main temple chamber. Pillars carved to resemble a great tree, with branches deliberately severed. Murals depict Morravel's doctrine: the elven race as a divine garden, other races as weeds to be pulled. Chilling in its beauty and craft.
- **The Testimony Walls** — A chamber where the cult recorded their actions in carved stone, believing they were righteous. Names of victims. Dates. Methods. This is the proof Caelen wanted found. It implicates Serelith by name and details the conspiracy with Lord Vane.
- **The Bone Garden** — Where the victims were interred. Dozens of skeletons arranged in ritual patterns. Half-elf, human, and "impure" elf remains. Some small enough to be children. This is the emotional core of the dungeon.
- **Serelith's Sanctum** — A private chamber used by the Warden herself. Contains personal effects, a journal detailing her philosophy and her arrangement with Vane, and a **sending stone** — paired with one that Vane still possesses. This is proof of the conspiracy at the highest level.

**Current occupant:** The Sanctum is not empty. **Vaelith Morravel's Chosen**, a cult remnant of 3-4 elves led by a **fanatic named Thessyn**, has been quietly restoring the temple. Thessyn is young — born after the battle — but is Serelith's ideological heir. He believes the cult's work was interrupted, not completed, and is preparing for a **second purge.** He has been in contact with sympathizers in the Silverwood and has recently acquired the means to perform a ritual that would "call the faithful" — essentially a magical signal that would rally Morravel's scattered followers across the Silverwood.

**The final confrontation** can involve combat, but also negotiation or manipulation. Thessyn is a true believer but not stupid. The Testimony Walls are his proof of righteousness — but they're also the evidence that could condemn his entire movement.

### Dungeon Factions Summary

| Faction | Leader | Goal | Attitude to Wychwood |
|---------|--------|------|----------------------|
| Thornfield's Company | Maren Thornfield | Profit from salvage | Indifferent/useful (will trade info for help) |
| Grey Sentinels | Aravain Ghostleaf | Protect the dead, find truth | Cautious ally (if Wychwood proves himself) |
| Morravel's Chosen | Thessyn | Restore the cult, prepare second purge | Hostile (Wychwood is half-elf — he IS the "contamination") |
| The Restless Dead | N/A (various undead) | Unfinished business | Varies — some hostile, some can be communicated with |

## 3. COMPANION NPCs

### Companion 1: Bryn Ashwick (Recruited Level 1-2)

- **Race:** Human
- **Class:** Fighter (Champion)
- **Age:** Mid-20s
- **Appearance:** Stocky, square-jawed, broken nose set badly. Short brown hair. Calloused hands. Wears practical, well-maintained chainmail.
- **Personality:** Blunt, practical, dry-humored. Not cruel but not sentimental. Drinks when she can afford it. Good in a fight, straightforward in conversation. Says what she means. Doesn't trust easily but once she does, she's solid.
- **Surface Reason for Travel:** Heading to Aeltharin Vale region for "salvage work" — she heard Thornfield's company is hiring muscle and the pay is good.
- **Hidden Agenda:** Bryn's older brother **Davin Ashwick** was a Dalereach soldier at the Battle of Aeltharin Vale. He was listed as killed in action, but Bryn found a letter among her recently-deceased mother's belongings suggesting Davin may have been taken prisoner rather than killed. She doesn't believe in ghosts, but she wants to find his remains — or, impossibly, find out if he survived. She hasn't told anyone because admitting her brother might have been captured by elves and not rescued is a family shame in the Dalereach. *(DM Note: Davin's remains ARE in the Bone Garden. He was a human prisoner executed in the massacre. Finding him will devastate Bryn and potentially turn her rage toward elves — or toward the people who covered it up. This is a loyalty fulcrum.)*
- **Loyalty Score:** 5/10 (starting). Bryn is professional, not sentimental. She'll stick around if the arrangement works.
- **Loyalty Triggers:**
  - **Increase:** Wychwood being honest with her, having her back in fights, not treating her like a hireling, helping her find out about Davin, respecting her grief when Davin's truth emerges
  - **Decrease:** Lying to her (she has a nose for bullshit), putting her in danger without warning, siding with elves reflexively against humans, hiding information about Davin
  - **Betrayal Condition:** If Bryn discovers the massacre evidence and believes Wychwood knew and didn't tell her, she will leave the party and potentially become an antagonist — taking the evidence to Dalereach hardliners who will use it to justify a new war
  - **Full Loyalty Condition:** Help her find Davin, give her space to grieve, and then support her decision about what to do with the truth. If she reaches 9+, she'll follow Wychwood through the Sanctum and beyond.

### Companion 2: Faelindra "Fael" Whisperwind (Recruited Level 2-3)

- **Race:** Elf (Silverwood)
- **Class:** Rogue (Arcane Trickster)
- **Age:** ~120 (young for an elf, equivalent to early 20s in human terms)
- **Appearance:** Lean, sharp-featured, silver-white hair cut short and ragged (unusual for a Silverwood elf — deliberate rejection of tradition). Quick grey eyes. Moves like water.
- **Personality:** Witty, evasive, never answers a direct question if she can avoid it. Covers genuine emotion with sarcasm. Fiercely independent. Has a complicated relationship with her elven heritage — proud of some things, ashamed of others. Will flirt with anyone, commit to no one.
- **Surface Reason for Travel:** Claims she's a courier carrying a sealed message to a contact near the Vale. The message is real — it's a mundane trade contract. The courier job is cover.
- **Hidden Agenda:** Fael is a **spy for the Silverwood ruling council.** The council has received intelligence that Morravel's cult is active again and has sent Fael to confirm and report back. She is NOT aligned with the cult — the council opposes them — but her orders are to **observe and report only**, not to intervene. If Wychwood and company stumble into the Sanctum, Fael's orders are to let events play out and bring intelligence back, even if that means letting people die. Her loyalty is to the Silverwood, not to the party. *(DM Note: Fael's handler is Warden-Commander Ithilien, a council member who was junior during the original battle and has spent twenty years rising to power partly by investigating the truth. He knows the massacre happened but is playing a long political game.)*
- **Loyalty Score:** 4/10 (starting). Fael is friendly but her real loyalty is elsewhere.
- **Loyalty Triggers:**
  - **Increase:** Wychwood being genuinely kind without expecting anything in return, demonstrating that half-elves are not the "contamination" the cult claims, putting himself at risk for her, showing her that some things matter more than politics
  - **Decrease:** Being cruel or dismissive about elven culture, killing elves unnecessarily, treating her like "the elf" rather than a person, being naive about politics (she'll lose respect)
  - **Betrayal Condition:** If Fael's loyalty is below 6 when the party reaches the Sanctum, she will prioritize her mission — potentially sabotaging the party's efforts to preserve evidence if the council decides the truth is too politically dangerous to reveal. She might steal the sending stone or destroy the Testimony Walls.
  - **Full Loyalty Condition:** If loyalty reaches 8+, Fael will break with her orders and fight alongside the party in the Sanctum. She'll face consequences from the council later, but she'll have chosen people over politics. This is her arc.

### Companion 3: Brother Aldous Greymantle (Recruited Level 3-4)

- **Race:** Human
- **Class:** Cleric (Life Domain)
- **Age:** 50s
- **Appearance:** Tall, gaunt, thinning grey hair. Kind eyes in a weathered face. Walks with a slight limp. Wears a simple grey travelling robe over practical armor. Carries a well-used mace and a holy symbol of **Rethain**, a god of mercy and passage.
- **Personality:** Gentle, patient, genuinely compassionate. Listens more than he talks. Has a calming presence. Seems grandfatherly and wise. The kind of man you want to confess your sins to. *This is the most dangerous NPC in the party.*
- **Surface Reason for Travel:** He says he's on a pilgrimage to "minister to the restless dead" at Aeltharin Vale. He has heard reports of undead stirring and believes they deserve peace. This is partly true.
- **Hidden Agenda:** Brother Aldous is **Lord Aldric Vane's agent.** Twenty years ago, Aldous was a young field chaplain attached to the Dalereach army. He witnessed the aftermath of the massacre from the human side — not the elven camp atrocity, but the way Vane's officers covered up their own commander's role in provoking the war. Aldous was horrified, lost his faith, and spent years as a drunk. Vane found him, dried him out, and "redeemed" him — giving him purpose, a parish, a flock. In return, Aldous became Vane's eyes and ears. He doesn't think of himself as a spy. He thinks of himself as a man repaying a debt to the person who saved his life. He has compartmentalized Vane's sins because acknowledging them would mean acknowledging that his own redemption was purchased. *(DM Note: Vane sent Aldous because Vane has learned — through the sending stone's partner activating — that someone is in the Sanctum. He needs to know if the evidence of his conspiracy with Serelith is about to surface. Aldous's real mission is to assess the situation and, if necessary, ensure the evidence is destroyed. Aldous does not know the full extent of Vane's crimes — he knows Vane provoked the war but not about the massacre arrangement with Serelith.)*
- **Loyalty Score:** 6/10 (starting). Aldous genuinely likes people and will naturally bond with the party. But his debt to Vane runs deep.
- **Loyalty Triggers:**
  - **Increase:** Showing mercy to enemies, protecting the innocent, treating Aldous's faith with respect (even if Wychwood doesn't share it), demonstrating that truth and justice matter even when they're costly
  - **Decrease:** Unnecessary cruelty, mocking his faith, treating him as disposable, making him complicit in violence against innocents
  - **Betrayal Condition:** When the party discovers the Testimony Walls, Aldous will face a crisis. If his loyalty is below 7, Vane's hold wins — Aldous will attempt to destroy evidence (set fire to documents, collapse a passage, steal the sending stone). He'll weep while he does it. He won't want to. But he'll do it, because admitting Vane is a monster means admitting his own redemption is a lie.
  - **Full Loyalty Condition:** If loyalty is 8+, the party's influence breaks Vane's hold. Aldous confesses everything — his past, his mission, Vane's involvement. He turns, becoming the party's most valuable ally because he can testify about Vane's role from the human side. His testimony plus the Sanctum evidence is a complete case.
  - **THE GRRM TWIST:** Even if Aldous turns loyal, he has already been sending reports to Vane via sending spell. Vane knows the party is coming. This cannot be undone. Aldous's loyalty shift means he stops reporting, but the damage is done — Vane has time to prepare countermeasures. True loyalty has consequences.

## 4. ARC STRUCTURE

### Arc 1: The Road from Millhaven (Levels 1-2)

**Level 1 (Sessions 1-3):**

*Theme: Departure and the weight of the past.*

- **Session 1:** Millhaven. Wychwood at the grave. Establish the world, the tone, the racial tension. A small encounter — perhaps a dispute between a human farmer and an elven trader on the road that Wychwood can observe or intervene in. No combat required. Set the mood.
- **Session 2:** Travel begins. First night on the road. Encounter with **wolves or bandits** (CR 1/4 each — 2-3 bandits or wolves). This is the mechanics tutorial. Introduce Bryn Ashwick — she's heading the same direction, pragmatic about safety in numbers. Potential camp scene, first conversation.
- **Session 3:** Arrive at **Thornbury**, a Dalereach market town a few days from Millhaven. Larger settlement, more visible racial tension. A half-elf merchant is being harassed/price-gouged. Bryn's reaction reveals her character. Encounter with **Harlen Greaves** (see Road NPCs below) at the tavern. First real social challenge. Optional combat: bar fight or ambush on the road out of town.

**Level 2 (Sessions 4-6):**

*Theme: The world is bigger than Millhaven, and more broken.*

- **Session 4:** Deeper into the Dalereach. Cross into contested territory — the borderlands where neither human nor elven law holds firmly. Encounter with **goblin raiders** (CR 1/4 each, group of 4-5) hitting a trade caravan. Chance to earn XP and reputation.
- **Session 5:** Encounter with Fael Whisperwind. She's being pursued by **two human bounty hunters** who claim she stole something (the "courier package"). She did steal it — it's her cover story and she lifted the contract from an actual courier. Combat or social resolution. Recruiting opportunity.
- **Session 6:** Arrive at **Ashenford**, the last significant settlement before the wilderness around Aeltharin Vale. This is the "last outpost" — a town built around a burned bridge over the River Ash, rebuilt twice. Heavy military presence (Dalereach border patrol). Encounter with **Captain Sera Coldwell** (see Road NPCs below). Intelligence gathering about the Vale. Level up to 3 should happen here or shortly before.

### Arc 2: The Contested Lands (Levels 3-4)

**Level 3 (Sessions 7-9):**

*Theme: Allegiances are tested. The world is not black and white.*

- **Session 7:** Travel from Ashenford into true wilderness. The forest thickens. Old battle scars — burned clearings, overgrown trenches. First encounter with **undead** (2-3 skeletons, remnants of the battle). The dead are stirring. Something is waking them.
- **Session 8:** Encounter with the **Grey Sentinels** (Aravain Ghostleaf's group) on the outskirts of the Vale. Tense standoff — they don't trust humans, and a half-elf with a human fighter companion isn't reassuring. Diplomacy required. Aravain knows Caelen's name and reacts to the surname Shatterstaff with visible unease. He won't say why yet.
- **Session 9:** Meet Brother Aldous on the road. He's tending to a wounded traveler (genuine — he is a real healer). His warmth and competence are immediately apparent. He asks to join, citing safety in numbers and his desire to reach the Vale. If the party investigates, his cover story checks out — he IS a traveling cleric, he DOES have a legitimate pilgrimage reason.

**Level 4 (Sessions 10-12):**

*Theme: The approach. Escalating danger. Secrets strain to surface.*

- **Session 10:** Thornfield's camp. Arrival at the Vale's edge. The salvage company is established. Maren Thornfield is practical and territorial — she doesn't want competition. Negotiation for access. The Grey Sentinels hover at the tree line, watching.
- **Session 11:** First descent into the War-Cellars. Exploration, environmental storytelling, discovery of the healer's journal. The first piece of the truth. Companion reactions: Bryn is unsettled, Fael is intensely focused (she's looking for cult signs), Aldous suggests prayer for the dead (and is quietly cataloguing what they find).
- **Session 12:** Deeper. The Ossuary Passage. Discovery of cult markings, the prisoner route, Caelen's mark on the wall. This is the emotional turning point — Wychwood's father was HERE, fleeing something terrible. What follows must be earned.

### Arc 3: The Sanctum (Level 5+)

**Level 5 (Sessions 13-16+):**

*Theme: Truth. Consequence. Choice.*

- **Session 13:** The wight guardian. A significant combat or social encounter. The wight may speak — it was one of Serelith's soldiers, bound in death, and it KNOWS what happened. It can provide context or misdirection depending on how the party approaches.
- **Session 14:** The Sanctum of Morravel. The Hall of Branches. First encounter with Thessyn's cult remnant. They may not be immediately hostile — Thessyn will want to know who these intruders are and what they know. A parley is possible before violence.
- **Session 15:** The Testimony Walls and the Bone Garden. The full truth revealed. Companion loyalty checks trigger. Bryn finds Davin. Fael recognizes the political implications. Aldous faces his crisis. This is the session where the party may fracture.
- **Session 16:** The confrontation with Thessyn. The choice about the evidence — preserve it, destroy it, take it, use it. Every faction wants a different outcome. The sending stone connects to Vane, who may attempt to intervene remotely. The party's decisions here determine the political future of the Dalereach-Silverwood relationship.

**Post-Sanctum:** What happens with the evidence drives the next arc. War? Justice? Cover-up? Depends entirely on player choice.

## 5. ROAD NPCs (Non-Companion, With Secrets)

### Harlen Greaves — The Recruiter

- **Location:** Thornbury (encountered Session 3)
- **Appearance:** Mid-40s human male, ruddy-faced, receding hairline, easy smile. Dresses like a prosperous merchant. Buys drinks freely.
- **Surface Identity:** A Dalereach merchant recruiting guards for a trade caravan heading toward the contested territories. Friendly, gregarious, seems like a useful contact.
- **Hidden Agenda:** Harlen is a **Dalereach intelligence operative** working for Lord Aldric Vane's network. He's stationed in Thornbury to monitor traffic heading toward Aeltharin Vale — Vane has become paranoid about the Sanctum being discovered. Harlen doesn't know WHY Vane cares about the Vale; he just reports names and descriptions of anyone heading that direction. He will report Wychwood's party.
- **Impact:** Harlen's report is how Vane learns about Wychwood. This triggers Vane sending Aldous to intercept. If the party kills or exposes Harlen, Vane finds out later through other means but Aldous arrives later (Session 10 instead of Session 9).
- **Combat Stats:** Commoner with a hidden dagger. Not a fighter. Will flee if threatened.

### Captain Sera Coldwell — The Honest Soldier

- **Location:** Ashenford (encountered Session 6)
- **Appearance:** Late 30s human woman, lean, angular face, close-cropped black hair. Military bearing. Tired eyes. Wears Dalereach border patrol armor, well-maintained but dented.
- **Surface Identity:** Commander of the Ashenford garrison. Professional, competent, and visibly exhausted. She's dealing with increased bandit activity, undead sightings near the Vale, and a garrison that's been reduced by budget cuts.
- **Hidden Agenda:** Sera has no treacherous agenda — she's genuinely a decent officer trying to do her job. Her SECRET is that she has been **quietly disobeying Lord Vane's orders** to restrict travel toward the Vale. Vane wants the Vale sealed off (ostensibly for "public safety"). Sera thinks the undead activity requires investigation, not avoidance, and has been allowing small parties through while filing false reports saying the road is impassable. She suspects her superiors are hiding something about the Vale but doesn't know what.
- **Impact:** Sera can provide practical help — maps, supplies, intelligence about the Vale region — but she's taking a risk doing so. If Vane discovers her disobedience, she'll be court-martialed. The party's actions at the Vale may eventually either vindicate her or condemn her.
- **Combat Stats:** Veteran (MM p. 350). Capable fighter if it comes to it.

### Duskmother Yenna — The Herbalist Witch

- **Location:** Encountered on the road between Thornbury and Ashenford (Session 4-5 area)
- **Appearance:** Old human woman, could be 60, could be 80. Wild grey hair, bark-brown skin, mismatched eyes (one blue, one milky-white). Travels with a mule loaded with dried herbs, poultices, and charms. Barefoot even in late autumn.
- **Surface Identity:** A wandering herbalist who trades remedies and folk cures at settlements too small for proper healers. Eccentric but harmless. Known in the borderlands as "the Duskmother." People either trust her completely or avoid her entirely.
- **Hidden Agenda:** Yenna is a **hedge witch with genuine minor magical ability** (mechanically: a low-level druid, ~level 3). She has lived in the borderlands for decades and **knows the dead at Aeltharin Vale are restless.** She has been performing small rituals at the Vale's edges to keep the undead contained, and she's failing — the activity of Thessyn's cult is stirring the dead faster than she can quiet them. She won't explain this directly. She speaks in riddles and metaphor.
- **What She Knows:** The Vale is "sick." Something is "feeding the roots with old blood." The dead remember what was done to them. She has seen "the mark of the eyeless tree" (Morravel's sigil) on stones near the Vale and knows it means an old evil. She will warn the party obliquely. If pressed, she'll give them a **charm against undead** (advantage on one saving throw against undead effects, single use) and say "the dead don't hate the living — they hate the ones who made them dead."
- **Combat Stats:** Druid (level 3). Will not fight the party under any circumstances. If attacked, she turns into a raven and flees.

## 6. TIMELINE OF WORLD EVENTS

*What happens in the wider world while Wychwood travels. These events proceed on schedule regardless of player action unless the player specifically intervenes.*

### Week 1 (Sessions 1-3): The Spark

- **Day 1-2:** Wychwood departs Millhaven. Nothing unusual.
- **Day 3-4:** In Thornbury. Meanwhile, in the Silverwood capital of **Vaelindor**, Warden-Commander Ithilien (Fael's handler) receives intelligence that Morravel cult activity has increased near the Vale. He dispatches Fael.
- **Day 5-7:** Harlen Greaves sends his first report about Wychwood to Vane's network. A pigeon carries the message. It will reach Vane in ~3 days.

### Week 2 (Sessions 4-6): The Escalation

- **Day 8-10:** A half-elf family in the border village of **Reedmere** is found murdered. The killings look like a robbery, but the method — throats cut, a sigil carved into the door — matches Morravel cult patterns. The local constable blames bandits. Sera Coldwell in Ashenford hears about it and is uneasy.
- **Day 11-12:** Lord Vane receives Harlen's report. He recognizes the surname "Shatterstaff" and understands the threat immediately. He contacts Brother Aldous via sending spell and redirects him toward the party's projected route.
- **Day 13-14:** In the Silverwood, a senior council member named **Tharivol** gives a public speech about "defending elven purity against the encroachment of human values." It's not quite Morravel rhetoric, but it's uncomfortably close. Moderate elves are alarmed. Ithilien suspects Tharivol is sympathetic to the cult but cannot prove it.

### Week 3 (Sessions 7-9): The Pressure Builds

- **Day 15-17:** Two Dalereach soldiers from the Ashenford garrison desert. They were Vane's plants, and they're heading to the Vale with orders to monitor Thornfield's salvage operation and prevent anyone from going underground. They arrive before the party.
- **Day 18-19:** Another killing in the borderlands — this time a human merchant known for trading fairly with elves. The message is becoming clearer: someone is targeting those who bridge the racial divide.
- **Day 20-21:** Thessyn's cult in the Sanctum completes a minor ritual, strengthening the undead activity in the Vale. The Grey Sentinels report more sightings. Aravain sends word to the Silverwood council requesting reinforcements. The request is "lost" by Tharivol's administrative staff.

### Week 4 (Sessions 10-12): The Breaking Point

- **Day 22-24:** Lord Vane pushes a resolution through the Dalereach parliament: increased military presence on the Silverwood border, framed as "response to undead threat." In reality, he's positioning forces in case the truth surfaces and he needs to control the narrative. Moderates in the parliament are concerned but outvoted.
- **Day 25-27:** The Silverwood council, alarmed by the Dalereach military buildup, mobilizes its own border forces. Ithilien argues for restraint. Tharivol argues for "decisive action." The political situation is one incident away from a new war.
- **Day 28:** If the party has not yet entered the Sanctum, Thessyn completes his major ritual: the "Calling of the Faithful." A magical pulse radiates from the Sanctum, perceptible to anyone with magical sensitivity within 50 miles. Morravel's scattered followers across the Silverwood receive the signal. They begin moving toward the Vale. The clock is ticking — within two weeks, Thessyn will have enough followers to attempt a genuine second purge.

### Week 5+ (Sessions 13-16): The Reckoning

- **If the party enters the Sanctum and reveals the truth:** The evidence destabilizes both governments. Vane attempts to suppress it politically. The Silverwood council is split between justice and cover-up. The outcome depends on who the party gives the evidence to, who they trust, and which allies survive.
- **If the party fails or is too slow:** Thessyn's second purge begins with attacks on half-elf communities in the borderlands. Vane uses the attacks to justify military action against the Silverwood. A new war begins — and this time, both architects (Vane engineering the human side, Thessyn engineering the elven side) are intentionally driving it.
- **If the party destroys the evidence:** The truth dies again. The tensions continue to simmer. Vane consolidates power. Thessyn retreats to rebuild. The cycle continues. Wychwood never learns the full truth about his father.

## 7. INTERCONNECTION MAP

*How everything ties together:*

```
LORD ALDRIC VANE (Dalereach) ←— original conspiracy —→ WARDEN SERELITH (Silverwood, status unknown)
        |                                                          |
        |— controls → Harlen Greaves (spy in Thornbury)            |— ideology inherited by → Thessyn (Sanctum cult leader)
        |— controls → Brother Aldous (agent in party)              |— investigated by → Warden-Commander Ithilien
        |— controls → Dalereach military buildup                   |— Ithilien sends → Faelindra "Fael" Whisperwind (spy in party)
        |— opposes  → Captain Sera Coldwell (honest soldier)       |— sympathizer → Councillor Tharivol (political ally)
        |                                                          |
        └——————— THE SANCTUM (evidence of both) ————————┘
                            |
                    CAELEN SHATTERSTAFF (witness, now dead)
                            |
                    WYCHWOOD SHATTERSTAFF (the inheritor)
                            |
            ┌———————————————┼———————————————┐
            |               |               |
        Bryn Ashwick    Fael Whisperwind   Brother Aldous
        (brother died   (council spy)      (Vane's agent)
         in massacre)
```

### Key Dramatic Ironies:
- Wychwood is traveling with an agent of the man who conspired to start the war that destroyed his father.
- Wychwood is traveling with a spy whose employer knows the truth but is playing politics with it.
- Wychwood is traveling with a woman whose brother was killed by the same atrocity that haunted his father.
- The only honest companion (Bryn) is the one most likely to cause a war if the truth comes out wrong.
- The most treacherous companion (Aldous) is the kindest and most likeable person in the party.
- The evidence that could bring justice could also start a new war. There may be no clean resolution.

## 8. WARDEN SERELITH — STATUS

Serelith's current status is deliberately unresolved for now. Possible developments for future arcs:

- **Dead:** She died years ago, but her legacy (the cult, Thessyn) lives on. Simplest option.
- **Alive and in hiding:** She's in deep exile in the Silverwood's outer reaches, old and bitter, still believing in her cause. Could appear as a late-game antagonist or tragic figure.
- **Alive and in power:** She returned to the council under a different identity. She IS Councillor Tharivol (or Tharivol's patron). The conspiracy runs deeper than anyone knows.

**Decision point:** Determine by Session 10 based on the direction the story is taking.

## 9. ENCOUNTER TABLE — ROAD TO AELTHARIN VALE

*Pre-rolled encounters for random use during travel. Scale as appropriate.*

| d8 | Encounter | CR | Notes |
|----|-----------|-----|-------|
| 1 | 2-3 wolves | 1/4 each | Hunting. Will flee if one is killed. |
| 2 | 3-4 bandits | 1/8 each | Desperate, not professional. Will surrender if losing. |
| 3 | 1 giant spider + webbed victim | 1 | Victim may be alive — a traveler or animal. |
| 4 | Racial incident — human mob harassing an elf or half-elf | Social | Tests Wychwood's values. No "right" answer. |
| 5 | Abandoned camp with signs of violence | Exploration | Investigation reveals what happened. Clue about borderland danger. |
| 6 | 2-3 skeletons (near the Vale) | 1/4 each | Restless dead. Wearing old military gear — human or elven. |
| 7 | Merchant caravan — opportunity to trade, gather rumors | Social | Rumors about undead, political tensions, or the salvage company. |
| 8 | Severe weather — storm forces shelter | Environmental | Forced proximity with companions. Good for character development. |

## 10. LOOT & REWARD PLANNING

### Key Items to Distribute (Levels 1-5):

- **Caelen's Lute** (already possessed): Will resonate in the Sanctum near Morravel's cult markings. Caelen enchanted it unconsciously with his grief — it hums a discordant note near the sigil of the eyeless tree. Narrative tool, not mechanical.
- **Healer's Journal** (War-Cellars, Session 11): Mundane but invaluable as evidence. Written in Elvish.
- **Charm of the Duskmother** (from Yenna, Sessions 4-5): Advantage on one save vs. undead effects. Single use.
- **+1 Shortsword** (found in the War-Cellars, Session 11-12): Elven make, still sharp after twenty years. Belonged to someone who died down there. Engraved name: "Lirael." If Wychwood researches the name, this is another thread to the truth.
- **Serelith's Sending Stone** (Sanctum, Session 15-16): Paired with Vane's stone. Can be used to contact Vane directly — or to trap him. Major plot device.
- **Morravel's Eye** (Sanctum, Session 15-16): An obsidian amulet in the shape of a closed eye. Thessyn's focus item. If claimed, grants the wearer darkvision 120 ft and the ability to cast *detect thoughts* once per long rest — but prolonged use (more than a week) begins to impose whispered suggestions of racial purity and separation. A cursed item that's useful enough to tempt. Requires attunement.
