## Current Adventure: The Tomb of Ashenfell

### Adventure Summary
A classic dungeon crawl starter adventure. The small mining town of Ashenfell has been plagued by disappearances - miners venturing into the old crypts beneath the hills never return. The town council is offering 50 gold pieces for someone brave (or foolish) enough to investigate.

**Truth:** The crypts were built over an ancient temple to a forgotten death god. A necromancer named Valen Murk has taken up residence and is using the miners as test subjects for his undead experiments. He seeks a ritual artifact hidden deep in the temple - the Soulstone of Karreth - which can bind souls.

**Adventure Tier:** Level 1-3
**Target Start:** Level 1
**Expected Endpoint:** Level 2-3 depending on thoroughness

## Starting Scenario - Session 1

### Where Hamm Begins
Hamm has been traveling the trade roads, performing in small towns and gathering stories. He arrived in **Ashenfell** three days ago and has been staying at the **Rusted Nail Inn**, performing each night for room and board.

The town is tense. Five miners have disappeared in the past two weeks. The town council posted a notice offering 50 gp to anyone who can solve the mystery and make the old mines safe again.

### Key Hook
The innkeeper's daughter, **Sera Blackwood** (16), has been secretly visiting the crypt entrance, leaving offerings for her dead mother whose spirit she believes is trapped there. She saw something moving in the darkness - shambling figures - and heard chanting in a language she didn't understand. She's terrified but doesn't want to tell her father (he'd forbid her from going). She might confide in Hamm if he seems trustworthy.

Alternative: The town council directly approaches Hamm after hearing his heroic tales, hoping he can back up his stories with action.

## Dungeon: The Tomb of Ashenfell

### Overview
3-level dungeon (small, designed for level 1 start):
- **Level 1:** Outer crypts (burial chambers, some looted, some trapped)
- **Level 2:** Temple level (ancient death god shrine, Valen's workshop)
- **Level 3:** Vault (where Soulstone is hidden, heavy undead presence)

### Level 1: Outer Crypts

**Entry Chamber:**
- Stone archway entrance, barricaded with planks (easy to remove)
- 20x20 room, exits to north and east
- Old offerings, burned-out torches
- **Trap:** Pressure plate triggers falling stone blocks (DC 12 Perception to spot, DC 12 DEX save or 1d6 damage)

**North Hall:**
- 10x40 corridor, burial niches on both sides
- Most coffins are stone, sealed
- **Encounter:** 3 skeletons (CR 1/4 each) animate if disturbed - former town guards
- **Loot:** Rusty weapons, a silver locket (5 gp), mining tools

**East Burial Chamber:**
- 30x30 room, stone sarcophagi in rows
- Evidence of recent looting (broken coffins)
- **Encounter:** 2 zombies (CR 1/4 each) - recent miners, identifiable by clothes
- **Clue:** Drag marks leading to stairs down (Valen moved bodies here)
- **Loot:** 15 gp in old coins, a healing potion hidden in a sarcophagus

**Stairs Down:**
- Descending staircase to Level 2
- Scorch marks on walls (failed undead got too close to Valen's magic)

### Level 2: Temple Level

**Shrine Chamber:**
- 40x40 central room, carved pillars
- Altar to Karreth (death god) - skull with seven eyes symbol
- **Encounter:** 4 skeletons (CR 1/4) standing guard
- **Clue:** Journal pages scattered on floor - Valen's notes about the Soulstone
- **Loot:** Scroll of Detect Magic, carved bone dagger (ritual implement, 20 gp)

**Valen's Workshop:**
- 20x30 side room, tables with alchemical equipment
- Cages with two survivors (barely alive): **Goran Steelhelm** and **Karst** - they can be rescued
- **Encounter:** Valen is here if the party has been loud. Otherwise, he's on Level 3.
- **Loot:** Spellbook (contains Ray of Sickness and Animate Dead), 30 gp, potions (2x healing)

**Rest Chamber:**
- Valen's sleeping area, bedroll, personal effects
- **Clue:** Letters from someone called "The Carrion Circle" - a network of necromancers
- **Loot:** 50 gp, map showing other ruins in the region

### Level 3: The Vault (Optional - May Be Too Deadly for Level 1)

**Guardian Chamber:**
- 30x30 room, stone door to vault
- **Encounter:** 1 **Wight** (CR 3) - ancient guardian, very dangerous
- **Alternative:** If party is level 1, this door is magically sealed and requires a key (Valen has it). Confronting Valen on Level 2 is the climax instead.

**Vault:**
- Small 15x15 chamber
- Pedestal with the **Soulstone of Karreth** (glowing black gem)
- Taking it triggers the Wight guardian (if not already fought)
- **Decision Point:** Should the party take it, destroy it, or leave it?

---

## Encounter Balance - Level 1 Party

**Easy Encounters (Warm-up):**
- 2 skeletons
- 1-2 zombies

**Medium Encounters:**
- 3 skeletons
- 2 zombies + environmental advantage for party

**Hard Encounters:**
- 4 skeletons in defensive position
- Valen + 2 zombies (action economy matters)

**Deadly (Avoid at Level 1):**
- Wight (CR 3) - only if party is level 2+
