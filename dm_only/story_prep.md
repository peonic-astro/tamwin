# DM Story Prep - Tamwin Badgerfoot Campaign

## The Strange Tingling (Core Mystery)

### What It Really Is
The "tingling" is not supernatural—it's **restlessness**. A deep, existential itch born from spending three years watching the same gate, walking the same streets, breaking up the same tavern fights in Burlap. Tamwin has convinced himself it's a sign, a calling, but it's actually the suffocating realization that he's wasting his life in a town where nothing ever happens.

The truth is darker: **there is no destiny**. The world doesn't care about Tamwin. He's one small halfling in a brutal, indifferent world. The tingling will fade once he faces real danger—replaced by fear, exhaustion, and the cold clarity that adventure isn't heroic, it's survival.

### Narrative Use
- Early on, Tamwin can interpret the tingling as guidance or intuition
- Let him feel "drawn" to opportunities—but never confirm it's real
- When he faces true horror (death, betrayal, moral compromise), the tingling stops
- If player asks about it later: "You realize you haven't felt it in days. Maybe you never needed it."

### The Real Hook
Tamwin left because he was **bored and afraid of dying ordinary**. That's human. That's real. The question is: will the world break him, or will he carve out something worth the cost?

## Opening Adventure: The Millstone Murders

### Setup
Tamwin arrives in **Millstone**, a small farming village (pop. ~200) two days west of Burlap. He's low on coin, looking for work. The village is tense—three people have died in the past two weeks under suspicious circumstances.

### The Victims
1. **Garrett Flynn** - Farmer, 40s. Found in his barn with his throat torn out. Locals say wolves.
2. **Mira Cartwright** - Weaver, 30s. Disappeared from her home at night. Found three days later in the woods, mauled.
3. **Old Tam** - Village drunk. Attacked two nights ago near the mill. Survived but delirious, babbling about "children's eyes."

### The Truth
Not wolves. Not children. **Feral dogs**—a pack of four, led by a particularly vicious mastiff gone wild after their owner (a trapper named Rodrick Vane) died of fever three weeks ago. The dogs have been hunting at night, desperate and starving.

**Stats:** Use **Wolf** stat block from SRD (CR 1/4). Four dogs total, but they don't attack all at once.
- Mastiff (pack leader): 15 HP, AC 13, +4 to hit, 2d4+2 damage
- Three mutts: 11 HP each, AC 13, +4 to hit, 2d4+2 damage

### Encounter Design (Gradual Build)
1. **First Night:** Tamwin hears howling. If he investigates, he sees the pack in the distance. They flee if approached.
2. **Second Night:** The dogs kill a sheep near the inn where Tamwin is staying. He can track them back to Rodrick's abandoned cabin (Survival DC 12).
3. **Confrontation:** Dogs defend their territory at the cabin. They're aggressive but not suicidal—if two are killed, the others flee.

**Environmental Advantage:** Cabin has a loft (high ground, +2 to ranged attacks), narrow doorway (creates chokepoint), and old furniture for cover.

### What If Tamwin Doesn't Act?
- **Day 3:** Another villager dies (a child this time). Village turns on itself—accusations of witchcraft, a scapegoat is chosen.
- **Day 5:** Villagers form a mob to burn **Elda's** cottage (see NPCs below). She flees or dies depending on PC intervention.
- **Day 7:** Dogs move on to another village. Millstone is fractured, paranoid, and has executed an innocent woman.

## NPCs - Millstone

### 1. Harren Blackwood (Village Headman)
**Role:** Authority figure, potential quest giver

**Appearance:** Broad-shouldered, early 50s, greying beard. Wears practical work clothes, not finery. Callused hands from decades of farming.

**Personality:** Blunt, pragmatic, tired. Not unkind, but stretched thin. Wants the problem solved quickly and cheaply.

**Motivation:** Protect the village, maintain order. Doesn't want outside authorities involved (would mean taxes, questions, scrutiny).

**Offer to Tamwin:** 20 gold pieces to deal with the "wolf problem." Will go to 30 if pressed, but resents it.

**Hidden Agenda:** **NONE.** Harren is exactly what he appears to be—a man trying to hold his community together. Not every NPC is scheming.

**Knows:** The locations of the attacks, rumors about Old Tam's ravings, and that Rodrick Vane died recently (but hasn't connected it to the dogs).

---

### 2. Elda Farrow (Herbalist)
**Role:** Information source, potential ally

**Appearance:** Wiry woman in her 60s, sharp grey eyes. Lives alone in a cottage on the village edge. Dries herbs from her rafters; cottage smells of sage and yarrow.

**Personality:** Abrasive, sarcastic, suspicious of outsiders. Softens if treated with respect. Has a dry, dark sense of humor.

**Motivation:** Survive. She's lived through three wars, two plagues, and a witch-burning in her youth. Knows how quickly mobs form.

**What She Offers:**
- Can identify animal tracks if Tamwin brings evidence ("Dog, not wolf. Big one.")
- Sells basic healing supplies (potion of healing: 50 gp, healer's kit: 5 gp)
- Warns Tamwin that scared people look for someone to blame

**Hidden Agenda:** **NONE.** But she's a convenient scapegoat. If Tamwin fails to solve the problem quickly, villagers will turn on her.

**Knows:** Rodrick Vane kept dogs. Hasn't seen them since he died. Suspects they've gone feral but hasn't said anything (afraid of being blamed).

---

### 3. Joram Creel (Innkeeper)
**Role:** Social hub, source of rumors

**Appearance:** Portly man, 40s, thinning hair. Always wiping his hands on his apron. Nervous energy.

**Personality:** Friendly but fearful. Wants to please everyone. Terrible at keeping secrets—gossips constantly.

**Motivation:** Keep the inn safe and profitable. Terrified the attacks will drive away travelers.

**What He Offers:**
- Room and board (5 sp per night, includes meals)
- Rumors and gossip (some true, some wild speculation)
- Will loan Tamwin a lantern if asked

**Hidden Agenda:** **YES.** Joram knows more than he's saying. He saw someone sneaking around the mill the night Old Tam was attacked—but it was **Harren's teenage son, Denn**, meeting a girl. Joram is protecting the boy (and staying in Harren's good graces) by keeping quiet. If pressed (Intimidation DC 13 or Persuasion DC 15), he'll admit what he saw but beg Tamwin not to tell Harren.

**Truth:** Denn has nothing to do with the murders. He's just a kid sneaking out to meet his sweetheart. But Joram's silence creates false leads and suspicion.

**Knows:** Timing of the attacks, gossip about Elda ("unnatural," "talks to herself"), and that Rodrick Vane's cabin is northeast of the village.

## Consequences & Branches

### If Tamwin Solves It Quickly (Within 3 Days)
- Village grateful but not effusive. Harren pays the agreed amount.
- Elda respects Tamwin's competence, offers a discount on future supplies.
- Tamwin earns a **minor reputation** as someone who gets things done.
- **XP Award:** 200 XP (four wolves defeated) + 50 XP (quest completion) = 250 XP total

### If Tamwin Delays or Fails
- Another death occurs (child or young woman).
- Village mob forms, targets Elda.
- If Tamwin defends Elda, he makes enemies in Millstone.
- If he doesn't, Elda dies or flees—haunts his conscience, becomes a story beat about consequences.

### If Tamwin Investigates Joram's Secret
- Discovers it's irrelevant to the murders but learns something about the village's social dynamics.
- Harren is angry if he finds out (his son's reputation matters to him).
- No mechanical benefit, but adds moral complexity: expose a harmless secret or let it lie?

### After Resolution
- Tamwin can stay in Millstone (safe base, but boring) or move on.
- If he helped Elda, she mentions a **larger problem** in the region: travelers disappearing on the Old Dust Road, 10 miles south. (Hook for next adventure.)
- If he leaves on bad terms, Millstone becomes a "closed door"—won't help him if he returns.

## World Event Timeline (If PC Doesn't Act)

### Day 1 (Arrival)
- Tamwin arrives in Millstone. Village is tense but functional.
- Dogs are hunting nightly, avoiding detection.

### Day 2
- Tamwin hears rumors, can investigate or ignore.
- If he does nothing, dogs kill another sheep.

### Day 3
- **Critical Point:** Dogs attack a child (8-year-old girl named Bess). She survives but is badly injured.
- Village panic escalates. Accusations begin.

### Day 4
- Mob forms. Elda is accused of witchcraft.
- Harren tries to maintain order but is losing control.

### Day 5
- If Tamwin hasn't intervened, Elda's cottage is burned. She escapes into the woods or dies (50/50).
- Dogs, spooked by the fire and noise, move on to another area.

### Day 6-7
- Village fractures. Families blame each other for "letting it happen."
- Harren's authority is undermined. He becomes bitter, drinks heavily.
- Millstone becomes a cautionary tale: a community destroyed not by monsters, but by fear.

### Long-Term Consequences
- If Elda dies, Tamwin hears about it weeks later (from a traveling merchant or bard).
- If she survives, she may reappear later in the campaign—either as an ally or a reminder of failure.

## Next Adventure Hooks (For Later Sessions)

### The Old Dust Road Disappearances
- Travelers vanishing on a specific stretch of road.
- **Truth:** A pair of **bandits** (CR 1/2 each) ambushing lone travelers. They're desperate, not evil—turned to crime after their farm was burned by raiders.
- Moral complexity: Kill them, turn them in, or find another solution?

### The Barrow Knight
- Rumors of an ancient barrow 15 miles north. Local legend says a knight was buried there with his sword.
- **Truth:** Barrow is real, but it's trapped and guarded by **skeletons** (CR 1/4). The sword is valuable but cursed (minor curse: disadvantage on Charisma checks while attuned; can be broken by a Remove Curse spell).
- Risk vs. reward: Is it worth delving into danger for treasure?

### The Night Hag of Cragmoor
- Distant rumor (should not be pursued until level 5+).
- A Night Hag (CR 5) terrorizes a village in the highlands.
- **Setup for later:** NPCs warn this is suicide for a lone level 1 fighter. Tamwin needs allies, levels, and preparation.

## NPC Loyalty & Commitment Tracking

### Harren Blackwood
- **Loyalty:** Neutral (0/10). Transactional relationship.
- **Commitment:** Will pay for results but won't go out of his way to help Tamwin otherwise.
- **How to Increase:** Solve the problem quickly and discreetly. Protect the village's reputation.

### Elda Farrow
- **Loyalty:** Suspicious (-2/10). Doesn't trust easily.
- **Commitment:** None initially. Will help if treated with respect.
- **How to Increase:** Defend her from accusations. Treat her as a person, not a resource.
- **If Maxed (8+/10):** Becomes a recurring ally. Offers information, supplies, and shelter in future adventures.

### Joram Creel
- **Loyalty:** Friendly but weak-willed (3/10).
- **Commitment:** Will gossip and provide minor help but won't take risks.
- **How to Increase:** Keep his secrets. Don't threaten his safety or business.

## DM Notes & Principles

### Tone Reminders
- **Dark but not hopeless.** Tamwin can make a difference, but it costs something.
- **NPCs are people, not quest givers.** They have fears, biases, and agendas.
- **Consequences persist.** Choices in Millstone echo forward. A saved life, a burned cottage, a kept secret—these matter.

### Encounter Balance
- Start with single-enemy encounters (one or two dogs at a time).
- Use terrain and environment to give Tamwin tactical options.
- If Tamwin is struggling, have NPCs offer help (for a price or favor).

### Player Agency
- Don't railroad. If Tamwin ignores the quest and leaves town, let him. Millstone burns, and he hears about it later.
- If he tries an unexpected solution (befriend the dogs, trap them, hire help), roll with it.
- The world responds to his actions but doesn't revolve around him.

### Mystery Design
- The feral dogs are a simple mystery with clear clues (tracks, timing, Rodrick's cabin).
- Joram's secret is a red herring—intentionally misleading but not essential.
- Let Tamwin feel clever when he solves it, but don't make it too easy.
