# DM Story Prep - Tamwin Badgerfoot Campaign

## The Strange Tingling (Core Mystery)

### What It Really Is
The "tingling" is not supernatural—it's **restlessness**. A deep, existential itch born from spending three years watching the same gate, walking the same streets, breaking up the same tavern fights in Burlap. Tamwin has convinced himself it's a sign, a calling, but it's actually the suffocating realization that he's wasting his life in a town where nothing ever happens.

The truth is darker: **there is no destiny**. The world doesn't care about Tamwin. He's one small halfling in a brutal, indifferent world. The tingling will fade once he faces real danger—replaced by fear, exhaustion, and the cold clarity that adventure isn't heroic, it's survival.

### Narrative Use
- Early on, Tamwin can interpret the tingling as guidance or intuition
- Let him feel "drawn" to opportunities—but never confirm it's real
- When he faces true horror (death, betrayal, moral compromise), the tingling stops
- If player asks about it later: "You realize you haven't felt it in days. Maybe you never needed it."

### The Real Hook
Tamwin left because he was **bored and afraid of dying ordinary**. That's human. That's real. The question is: will the world break him, or will he carve out something worth the cost?

- **Active Obligations:** None currently

### Completed Threads

- ✓ Millstone dog murders (Session 2) - Eliminated threat, earned 35gp + reputation

### Open Threads from Previous Sessions

**The Bandits from Day 1:**
- Still at large in the region (the three who escaped Tamwin)
- May resurface as enemies, complications, or encounters
- Know Tamwin killed their companions
- Potential for revenge, avoidance, or negotiation

### Available Adventure Hooks (Day 3+)

**LOCAL OPTIONS (Near Millstone):**

### 1. The Old Dust Road Disappearances
**Distance:** 10 miles south of Millstone
**Difficulty:** CR 1/2 encounter (appropriate for Level 2)
**Hook Source:** Elda could mention this if Tamwin asks about regional problems

**Setup:**
- Travelers vanishing on specific stretch of road over past month
- Local merchants worried, considering hiring guards
- **Truth:** A pair of **bandits** (CR 1/2 each) ambushing lone travelers
- **Moral Complexity:** They're desperate, not evil—turned to crime after their farm was burned by raiders
- **Potential Outcomes:** Kill them, turn them in to authorities, negotiate, find them work, discover who burned their farm

**Encounter Design:**
- Two bandits (use Bandit stat block, CR 1/8 each, or scale to CR 1/2)
- Ambush tactics (hidden, surprise round potential)
- Environmental factors: forested road, cover, escape routes
- Willing to surrender if outmatched
- Can provide information about regional threats if captured/negotiated with

### 2. The Barrow Knight

**Hook Source:** Local legend, could hear at Joram's inn

**Setup:**
- Ancient barrow where a knight was buried with his sword
- Locals avoid it (superstition)
- **Truth:** Barrow is real, trapped, guarded by **2-3 skeletons** (CR 1/4 each)
- **Treasure:** Longsword +1 (cursed: disadvantage on CHA checks while attuned; Remove Curse breaks it)
- **Dungeon Elements:** Traps (pit trap, poison dart), puzzle (correct tomb to open), undead guardians

**Encounter Design:**
- Small dungeon (3-4 rooms)
- Environmental hazards as much as combat
- Risk vs reward: valuable weapon but cursed
- Opportunity to learn about curse removal options

### 3. Millstone Regional Problems (Minor Hooks)
**Available from local NPCs if Tamwin asks around:**

- **Missing Livestock** - Harren mentions a farmer east of town losing chickens (potential giant rats, CR 1/8)
- **Haunted Mill** - Joram gossips about strange noises at the old mill (not actually haunted, just structural damage and wind)
- **Herb Gathering** - Elda could hire Tamwin to escort her to dangerous area to gather rare herbs (travel encounter, potential wilderness threats)

**DISTANT OPTIONS (Require Travel):**

### 4. Return to Burlap
**Distance:** 2 days east
**Potential Activities:**
- Visit family (parents Willa and Thorn)
- Check in with former Guard Captain
- Resupply in larger town
- Hear rumors about larger regional issues

### 5. The Night Hag of Cragmoor
**Distance:** Unknown (highlands, several days travel)
**Difficulty:** CR 5 (DEADLY for current level)
**Status:** DISTANT RUMOR ONLY - NOT READY

- Requires: Higher level (5+), allies, preparation, magical weapons
- Setup for much later in campaign

---

## Session 3 Planning Considerations

**Player Agency:**
- Let Tamwin decide next steps (stay in Millstone, travel, pursue hooks)
- Don't force a specific adventure
- Present options through natural NPC conversations, not menu

**Pacing Options:**
1. **Rest & Recover** - Tamwin could stay in Millstone, roleplay with NPCs, gather information
2. **Local Adventure** - Old Dust Road or Barrow Knight (both level-appropriate)
3. **Travel** - Return to Burlap, explore new location
4. **Random Encounter** - Traveling merchant with news, bandit ambush, wilderness threat

**Encounter Balance:**
- Tamwin is Level 2 (19 HP, AC 16, improved damage output)
- Appropriate threats: CR 1/4 to CR 1 creatures in groups
- Single CR 2 creature is "hard" encounter
- CR 3+ is deadly unless special circumstances

**Resource Tracking:**
- 29gp is decent but not wealthy
- Track rations, ammunition, equipment wear
- Healing resources limited (no potions unless purchased)

**World Building:**
- Mention regional politics, rumors, larger events in passing
- The world doesn't revolve around Tamwin
- Other adventurers exist, other problems are being solved (or not)

## DM Notes & Principles

### Tone Reminders
- **Dark but not hopeless.** Tamwin can make a difference, but it costs something.
- **NPCs are people, not quest givers.** They have fears, biases, and agendas.
- **Consequences persist.** Choices echo forward. A saved life, a burned cottage, a kept secret—these matter.

### Encounter Balance (Lessons from Session 2)
- **Session 2 worked well:** CR 1/4 enemies (4 dogs) at Level 1 was challenging but fair
- Terrain and tactical options made the difference (cabin loft, doorway chokepoint)
- Player felt smart for using environment, not just lucky
- Continue this approach: provide tactical choices, not just dice rolls
- For Level 2: CR 1/4 to CR 1 enemies in small groups remain appropriate
- Single CR 2 is "hard," CR 3+ is deadly

### Player Agency
- Don't railroad. If Tamwin ignores hooks, the world continues.
- If he tries unexpected solutions, roll with it and adjudicate fairly.
- The world responds to his actions but doesn't revolve around him.
- Let consequences develop naturally from choices.

### Mystery & Investigation Design
- Provide clear clues but don't hand-hold
- Red herrings are fine (like Joram's secret) but don't make them frustrating
- Let player feel clever when they solve problems
- Investigation should feel rewarding, not like pixel-hunting

### Session 2 Lessons Learned

**What Worked:**
- Gradual investigation with multiple NPC interactions
- Clear tracking mechanics led to satisfying resolution
- Tactical combat with environmental features
- Reward distribution (negotiating payment, giving proof to villagers) felt natural
- Player felt competent and capable

**What to Continue:**
- Provide meaningful tactical choices in combat
- Let player negotiate and make social choices
- Track NPC reactions and relationships
- Allow generosity or pragmatism based on player preference

**Notes for Future:**
- Millstone is now a safe base and resource
- Player has demonstrated: tactical thinking, fairness, competence
- These traits should influence how future NPCs react to Tamwin's reputation
- Word spreads slowly (takes time for reputation to reach distant areas)

## Long-Term Story Arcs (To Develop Later)

### Arc 1: The Weight of Heroism (Levels 1-3)
- Tamwin takes on small problems (bandits, beasts, local threats).

### Arc 2: The Broken Kingdom (Levels 4-6)
- Larger threats emerge. Tamwin gets involved in regional politics.
- Theme: Power corrupts. Good intentions lead to terrible outcomes.
- Endpoint: Tamwin must choose a side in a conflict with no clear "good guys."

### Arc 3: The Price of Legend (Levels 7-10)
- Tamwin faces threats that challenge his survival and morality.
- Theme: What are you willing to sacrifice? Your safety? Your principles? Your soul?
- Endpoint: Tamwin becomes the kind of legend bards sing about—or the kind they whisper warnings of.
